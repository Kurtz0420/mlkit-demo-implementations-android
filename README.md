# mlkit-demo-implementations-android
Powerful and easy-to-use machine learning kit from Google

# ML-Kit Demo
This sample app includes starter implementations of the following ml kit capabilities

# Smart Reply
Smart Reply API can automatically generate relevant replies to messages. Smart Reply helps respond to messages quickly, and makes it easier to reply to messages on devices with limited input capabilities.

# Image Labeling
Image labeling API can recognize entities in an image without having to provide any additional contextual metadata, using either an on device API or a Cloud- based API.

# Text Recognition
Text recognition APIs can recognize text in any Latin-based language. Text recognition can be used to automate tedious data entry for credit cards, receipts, and business cards. With the Cloud-based API, it can also extract text from documents, which you can use to increase accessibility or translate documents.

# Language Identification
With ML Kit's on-device language identification API, you can determine the language of a string of text. Language identification can be useful when working with user-provided text, which often doesn't come with any language information. Detect 103 languages with only a couple of words in one to two milliseconds.

# Language Translation
Translation API translates text between 58 languages. API operates entirely on device so the context of the translated text never leaves the device.You can use it to enable users to communicate with others who don't understand their language or to translate user-generated content.

# Additional Info
There are still other API's of Ml-kit not included in this sample, all of which share common implementation methods as above five API's.
